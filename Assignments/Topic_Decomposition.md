Below is my miro mindmap/flowchart that decomposes my project. I used the relationship lines as my key, for example, from the sub topic Planning there are a few sub topics. The link betweeen said sub topic and the embedded sub-topics are notable: 

The key: 
* RED = This seems like its going to make my rip my hair out
* Orange = This requires further research. Will have to add sub-topics to these areas. Ideally, finding guides, etc. 
* Green = Okay I have done this before, and this should not cause any hiccups.
