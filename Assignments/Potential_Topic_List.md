This page is home to my two intial project ideas for this semester. See below for the topic followed by its definition. 

1. Multi-cloud hybrid infrastructure. Instead of having only one cloud security solution/vendors (Microft, AWS, or GCC), networks should implement multiple clouds. I find this topic interesting because of the recent cyber incidents related to cloud security. Microsoft is facing scrutiny due to their mishandling/ lack of clarity they are providing to  clients that were effected by a zero-day vulnerabiltity (embedded into their cloud features/tools). One of the most notable victims of this incident was the U.S. government - more specifically,secrataries and other gov. employees emails were breached by a threat actor due to this clouds' embedded vulnerability. This scenario really inspired/motivated this capstone idea. Businesses/companies should not be reliant on a singular infrastructure as a service (Iaas)providor. Each providor has very unique features/services/tools in their cloud solution, that when overlapped with eachother, can provide more security to a network than a single cloud infrastrcture. 

2. Common ontology for firewall (the exact type of data is to be decided) telemetry. Custom data framework that would remap/reformat firewall logs into a singular format. I find this idea interesting because I believe the fact that security vendors do not have to abide/construct/follow a specific data format for their product's telemetry is absurd. The lack of this standard is causing security analyst to learn multiple different data formats which can be not only time consuming but also a large financial lift. I believe this topic would consist of me gathering a large amount of data from firewalls (For ex: Palo Alto FW) and recognizing what in the data format is user intuitive and what is not. I then would have to find out a way to reformat the data/fields that are not helpful/exclusive to the fw, and remap these fields/data formats to be more user friendly/intuitive.
