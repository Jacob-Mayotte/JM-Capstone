# Topic: Multi-Cloud Hybrid Infrastructure


### Topic Overview:

 Multi-cloud hybrid infrastructure. Instead of having only one cloud security solution/vendors (Microft, AWS, or GCC), networks should implement multiple clouds.  Businesses/companies should not be reliant on a singular infrastructure as a service (Iaas)providor. Each providor has very unique features/services/tools in their cloud solution, that when overlapped with eachother, can provide more security to a network than a single cloud infrastrcture. 


### Why? 

 I find this topic interesting because of the recent cyber incidents related to cloud security. Microsoft is facing scrutiny due to their mishandling/ lack of clarity they are providing to  clients that were effected by a zero-day vulnerabiltity (embedded into their cloud features/tools). One of the most notable victims of this incident was the U.S. government - more specifically,secrataries and other gov. employees emails were breached by a threat actor due to this cloud's embedded vulnerability. This scenario really inspired/motivated this capstone idea.
 
 This approach to a network infrastructure has a plethora of benefits when compared to a single IaaS network. 
 
###### For example: 
 - No Vendor lockins
 - Robust damage controls 
 - Easier Migration 
 - Competitive pricing for cloud vendors - potentially an area to save costs
 - Easier scalibility & agility
 - Segmentation/Administration can ease

##### Constraints: 
 As of now my constraints are quite surface level: 

 - What my actual deliverable will be? 
 - Analyzing different clouds and finding the most optimal version? This will require some research into what security features are genuinely beneficial to a company. 
 - What is the use case of this project?
